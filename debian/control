Description: base files for distributions
 Creates user `user` with password `changeme` (not in Qubes).
 That is if user `user` is not existing yet.
 And if it does create user `user` it also locks the root account.
 Therefore root account locking effectively only happens in new
 builds not having user `user` already created.
 .
 Adds user `user` to groups `cdrom,audio,dip,sudo,plugdev`.
 .
 Ships a systemd unit file dist-skel-first-boot.service
 which runs `/usr/libexec/helper-scripts/first-boot-skel`
 (part of helper-scripts) package.
 .
 Simplifies sudo default lecture to only showing the default password once.
 .
 Creates version file `/var/lib/dist-base-files/build_version`.
 .
 This package gets installed by default in both, Kicksecure and Whonix.
