Description: base files for Anonymity Distributions
 Creates user "user" with password "changeme" (not in Qubes).
 That is if user "user" is not existing yet.
 And if it does create "user" user it also locks the root account.
 Therefore root account locking effectively only happens in new
 builds not having user "user" already created.
 .
 Adds user "user" to groups "cdrom,audio,dip,sudo,plugdev".
 .
 Creates version file /var/lib/anon-dist/build_version.
 .
 Anonymized operating system user name "user", /etc/hostname, /etc/hosts,
 /etc/machine-id, /var/lib/dbus/machine-id, which should be shared among all
 anonymity distributions. See also:

 .
 Simplifies sudo default lecture to only showing the default password once.
 .
